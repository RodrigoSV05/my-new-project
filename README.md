# AI-Based Predictive Models for Financial Optimization

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Applying AI to cost modeling enables companies to predict project costs more accurately, optimize decision-making, and detect risks early by learning from historical data, driving operational efficiency and competitiveness.

## Background

Traditionally, cost models in engineering and manufacturing have relied on deterministic methods, static spreadsheets, or expert judgment. These approaches often lack adaptability to evolving market conditions and complex project requirements. Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML), provides tools that can learn from historical data patterns and progressively improve predictions, offering dynamic and data-driven support to decision-making processes. From my pwn experience, I have had to manually estimate project costs using historical data and assumptions without the support of predictive tools. This process was time-consuming, prone to inconsistencies, and limited in its ability to capture hidden patterns or anticipate future risks.This would have made my previous work significantly more efficient and accurate.

## How is it used?

AI would be implemented by training Machine Learning models using historical company data, such as material, labor, subcontracting, and overhead costs, along with project-specific variables (type, duration, supplier data, economic indicators).
The trained model could:

* Predict costs for new projects based on initial parameters.
* Identify key drivers of cost overruns.
* Detect anomalies and potential budget risks.
* Simulate different scenarios to support strategic decision-making.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
* Project completion records.
* Procurement and logistics databases.
* Indirect cost and maintenance reports.
* Financial databases.
* External variables (inflation rates, raw material prices, regulations).

AI Methods: Supervised regression models for numeric cost predictions, decision trees and Random Forest for non-linear relationships, neural networks for large and complex datasets and clustering techniques to group similar projects and optimize comparisons.

## Challenges

Data quality: incomplete or unstructured data can impact model performance.
Model updating: frequent retraining to adapt to economic and operational changes.
Organizational resistance and ethics: gaining trust in AI-driven predictions.

## What next?

After developing an initial functional model, the next step would be to integrate it into internal systems through interactive dashboards, early warning alerts for cost deviations, and automated reporting tools.
Later stages could evolve towards a recommendation system that not only predicts costs but also suggests optimized decision paths aligned with the companyâ€™s strategic goals.
